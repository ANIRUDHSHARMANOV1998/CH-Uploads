# CH-Uploads
A small project in PHP/MySQL to manage/store my images and videos that I share. This way I don't need third-party services, or have to put up with compression.

## Set Up

**Requirements**
- PHP
- MySQL
- fileUploads must be turned on in php.ini
- You should probably secure the dashboard.php file, otherwise anyone can upload stuff!

Copy the files to your server.

Create Database using Database.sql file.

Change login details in the connection.php file.

Change Site name and Twitter username in customisation.php file.
